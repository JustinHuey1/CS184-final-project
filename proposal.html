  <h1>
    Mesh simplification & Remeshing 
  </h1>
  
  <p>
In this project, we are implementing a remeshing project that is based on our implementation of project 2. We are going to implement mesh simplification and remeshing techniques including isotropic remeshing algorithm and simplification via quadric error.

  <h3>
    Project Discription>
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    Some meshes have a lot of unnecessary triangles and simplification can save a lot of time and space in memory. We can use remeshing to find a better representation of the same surface to make the mesh look better with the same amount of triangles and make the triangles all have uniform shape and size. We can use simplification to better compute the triangles in the meshes, primarily their location and how they are oriented to be able to use less triangles in the mesh and still create a similar looking mesh to the more inefficient one. This problem is important because mesh editing processes are widely used and especially when we are working with larger, more complicated meshes, computational time and space in memory can become more vital. The problem of remeshing is challenging because it requires computational depth in order to make the mesh more realistic and good looking. We use algorithms taught in lecture to implement these techniques: isotropic remeshing to make all the triangles uniform and quadratic error simplification to collapse edges and remove triangles.

  <h3>
    Goals and Deliverables
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    We plan to deliver a functional program that will correctly implement the algorithms described above. We should be able to import any meshes and output an edited version that is simplified and remeshed. The edits should be most importantly, obvious to spot in the gui when inspecting the mesh. We will compare the number of triangles used and focus in on a particular part of the mesh for with and without remeshing/simplification to see how the triangles are structured. We will take a look at both simple and complicated meshes. We should also compare our implementation to other versions of the implementation of the algorithm to see if we implemented correctly. We think we can accomplish this goal because this goal is reachable and realistic to reach within a four week period. We should look at the result of our simplification algorithm and see whether or not it meets the satisfaction that it still resembles the basic shapes of the original mesh.
  </p>
  
  <break></break>
  
  <p>
    If things go well, then we can consider implementing some other different simplification and remeshing algorithms into our program. We can then compare how the algorithms differ and see which ones are better and more efficient, primarily looking at runtime, memory used, and number of triangles in the meshes.

  <h3>
    Schedule
  </h3>
  
  <p>
      1st week: research on the algorithms and how to implement them correctly
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Look at the lecture again and the slides on the website to see the algorithms used
    </li>
    <li> Maybe we need to attach a new key to the GUI in order to make the new function work.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      2nd week: Work on simplification algorithm and try to make it functional
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make a copy of the code from project 2 and build a different function on top of the existing code in order to make it functional.
    </li>
    <li>Look at outside information to see if there are any similarities or more information that will help us to implement the algorithms.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      3rd week: Work on remeshing algorithm and try to make it functional
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Same as above
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      4th week: Work on the presentation, and record the presentation.
