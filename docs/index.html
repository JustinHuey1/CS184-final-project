        In this project, we decided to implement mesh simplification and remeshing. Currently, we have finished the simplification part. This consisted of implementing edge collapse operation and quadric error mesh simplification. In the future, we are going to finish up the project by implementing remeshing and trying to compare how meshes look and run time differences. We already have a plan for how to accomplish these.

    <p>To be able to simplify the mesh, this required collapsing edges, so we tackled this issue first. We implemented this similarly to how we implemented the other local mesh operations in project 2. We first started by drawing out the triangles and the result of calling edge collapse on it. We initially used the ten triangle mesh from lecture but as we were doing it, we figured that it was too gruesome to do everything according to the ten triangles and realized that we only necessarily needed the two triangles in the middle of the mesh. We then changed some pointers for the components of the mesh and deleted some accordingly to the result of edge collapse. We then had a bug where calling edge collapse on certain edges would sometimes give us errors and we found this stack over flow post that gave us our fix. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27049163/mesh-simplification-edge-collapse-conditions

      <p>
        For simplification, we implemented the quadric error simplification algorithm given in lecture. We primarily used the lectures slides as a resource and the paper Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics by Garland and Heckbert for computations. Quadric error simplification is a method that calculates the quadric errors for every edge by calculating the quadric errors for every vertex which are calculated by the quadric errors of every face. Then, by putting all the edges into the priority queue sorted by the cost of collapsing those edges, we could collapse the edges starting from the smallest cost until we reach a target number of faces in our mesh. (In our example, the target is half the total triangles)

      <p>
        During our implementation process, we encountered several bugs. One of them is when collapsing the edges we encountered errors such as that the edges and half edges sometimes got corrupted. We fixed this problem by properly returning a null vertex and checking if the collapsing edge returns a null vertex in the simplification function. Another problem is that our quadric error calculation was wrong and the resulting output mesh becomes very weird. We fixed this problem by consulting the paper noted above and it works.

        CS184 final project proposal
    </h1>

    <p>
        In this project, we are implementing a remeshing project that is based on our implementation of project 2. We are going to implement mesh simplification and remeshing techniques including isotropic remeshing algorithm and simplification via quadric error.

    <h3>
        Project Discription
    </h3>

    <p>
        Some meshes have a lot of unnecessary triangles and simplification can save a lot of time and space in memory. We can use remeshing to find a better representation of the same surface to make the mesh look better with the same amount of triangles and make the triangles all have uniform shape and size. We can use simplification to better compute the triangles in the meshes, primarily their location and how they are oriented to be able to use less triangles in the mesh and still create a similar looking mesh to the more inefficient one. This problem is important because mesh editing processes are widely used and especially when we are working with larger, more complicated meshes, computational time and space in memory can become more vital. The problem of remeshing is challenging because it requires computational depth in order to make the mesh more realistic and good looking. We use algorithms taught in lecture to implement these techniques: isotropic remeshing to make all the triangles uniform and quadratic error simplification to collapse edges and remove triangles.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Goals and Deliverables
    </h3>

    <p>
        We plan to deliver a functional program that will correctly implement the algorithms described above. We should be able to import any meshes and output an edited version that is simplified and remeshed. The edits should be most importantly, obvious to spot in the gui when inspecting the mesh. We will compare the number of triangles used and focus in on a particular part of the mesh for with and without remeshing/simplification to see how the triangles are structured. We will take a look at both simple and complicated meshes. We should also compare our implementation to other versions of the implementation of the algorithm to see if we implemented correctly. We think we can accomplish this goal because this goal is reachable and realistic to reach within a four week period. We should look at the result of our simplification algorithm and see whether or not it meets the satisfaction that it still resembles the basic shapes of the original mesh.
    </p>

    <break></break>

    <p>
        If things go well, then we can consider implementing some other different simplification and remeshing algorithms into our program. We can then compare how the algorithms differ and see which ones are better and more efficient, primarily looking at runtime, memory used, and number of triangles in the meshes.
